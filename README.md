# Vegarden

Vegarden is a social blogging network focused on promoting veganism and
creating a community of people interested in vegan philosophy.
This project aims to create a space where users, known as Zenytes,
can express themselves, share experiences, and contribute to the
vegan community through their personal blogs.
